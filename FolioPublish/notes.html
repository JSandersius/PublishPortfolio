How to make parallax work with particles.js.. well these are the windows in between sections that show the particling in
all its glory

<div class="window">
    <div class="caption">
    </div>
</div>



these elements get their image(background) from this css
<style>
    .window {
        position: relative;
        opacity: 0.65;
        background-attachment: fixed;
        background-position: center;
        background-repeat: no-repeat;
        background-size: cover;
        background-image: url("particles-js");
        min-height: 100%;
    }
</style>


this is what the css looks like for the particles.js element
